# Face Recognition App


This app uses the [ClarifaiFace API](https://www.clarifai.com/use-cases/facial-recognition) 

This app is not connected to a backend but simulates it.
When a user logs in they can add the url for image with a face.
Click detect and the app will detect all the faces in the image.
